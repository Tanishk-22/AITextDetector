# Project Overview

This repository demonstrates how to use a Naive Bayes classifier and fine-tune a BERT model to classify human-written vs. AI-generated text. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, contains essays authored by humans and various AI models.

## File Structure

- **nlpProjectPt1.py**  
  Preprocesses the text and trains a Naive Bayes model using TF-IDF features.

- **nbInference.py**  
  Loads the Naive Bayes model saved in `nlp_project_pt1` and performs inference on new text.  
  _Usage:_ Download the saved model files and update the directory path in this script.

- **nlpProjectPt2.py**  
  Fine-tunes an uncased BERT classifier using Hugging Faceâ€™s `Trainer` API and saves the trained model.

- **bertInference.py**  
  Loads the fine-tuned BERT model from `nlp_project_pt2` and performs inference on new text.  
  _Usage:_ Download the `human-ai-model` folder and update the model directory path in this script.

- **final_split_dataset.csv**  
  Contains the preprocessed and split dataset used for training and evaluation in Part 2. This file also serves as an index for identifying false positives and false negatives.
