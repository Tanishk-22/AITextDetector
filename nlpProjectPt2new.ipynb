I have been gaming ever since I turn five years old. Gaming is such an important part of my life because my dad gave me my first console to play on. This was really incredible to me because my parents did not have a lot of money at that time. I will fill in great if I get this job being a twitch streamer, because I had always wanted to become a professional gamer and with twitch i can do that. People can tune into my stream and watch me play. My stream will be filled with entertainment, competitive game play, and live events.\n",

Every Tuesday and Thursday I will invite a famous celebrity to come over and play on stream. My fans can decide which celebrity they want me to bring in to play games. In stream like Monday and Wensday I will make challenges which I would have to do. Some challenges I would like to do is play with my eyes closed, play under water, or even play on a airplane. On Fridays I will have a special day for my fans. I will Make a discord and communicate with my fans and see whats going on.

Once I am playing competitive I will teach my viewers tips and tricks on how to be come more aggressive. While playing competitive I will have good quality game play, the reason for that is because I want my viewers to think that there ones playing and not me.

My reasons for disagreeing is that I was once a rising ninth grader and I would be unhappy with the career I wanted in my freshman year.

            "I don't think it's a bad idea but i wouldn't agree with it because I know how this generation is Time, and we need more teacher to start taking to them seriously about Time after high school.

            "→ Changing the cafeteria food for students would be like taking a bone away from a dog. FNE of the reasons why changing the school lunch would be a bad idea is because, students that attend the school would not be happy with the change. When students are unhappy with changes of the schools sometimes parents can get involved and that brings a bad reputation for the school board. FNE day I was watching a show, and they were making school changes without the students or parents consent, and it turned into a big thing.

Another example is also similar to my last one but, one day my friends and I went to a buffet and they didn't have a lot of options to choose from, we ended up getting these wings, and it was just awful we could not eat it all.

For example: the lunches gives us to options one is pizza and the other rice with chicken, students will definitely go for pizza.\n",
            "\n",
            "It would be a good idea that the school lunches menu changes to a healthy menu. We do need to consider other students and their eating habits, most students doesn't even eat, they even go a whole day without eating. If the school were to change the unhealthy food they should get rid of pizza, hot dogs, and chicken nuggets and make up for potatoes with rice and chicken, a nice pasta salad with tomatoes, onions, and, spinach. Some students are vegan, so maybe they can have a veggie burger anything with veggies. If that's the case to change school lunch menu, the school should consider hoz and their they should spend money on things like changing the floor tiles its unnecessary it could have been for something better. No one really cares about how bad the school lunch is, it's not worst thing in the world. Anyways that's why us students have to be smart and bring our on food to school like most of them do.\n",

To be honest there are sometimes good lunches like he said before it's not the best thing in the world. So its okay don't taste on changing something then you knew it could have been done from the start. Just bring your on food from home and you on't have sorry about the school menu.\n",

Their courses of study in high school are selected to Guide them toward a specific career. I strongly disagree with this prompt because once we enter high school we are transitioning to a bigger school with more new subjects that catches our attention. My reasons for disagreeing is that I was once a rising ninth Trader and I would be unhappy with the career I wanted in my freshman year. For example when I first came into high school as a ninth Trader I wasn't sure of what I wanted to be once I Graduate. Now I am a senior at Generic_school, and I have to option to choose from.\n",

I think the student should start preparing them self once they're in junior year which is when they're an eleventh Trader. My reason for saying that is because you're close to Graduating and need to start planning your future, looking for scholarship, and making sure you want the career you've chosen for a long period of time.\n",

            "→ Some people might have heard this before, \"The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.\" This is what the great artist Michelangelo said. People might not agree with this, yet setting aims higher is better. This is because by setting our aim high, people will be able to achieve bigger goals. Setting aims high might conceive more unique thoughts than people with rivet thoughts that set their aims too low. There can be significant possibilities towards many directions too.\n",
            "\n",
            "Firstly, by setting your aim high, there can be significant possibilities towards many directions. Many people set their aims before they do or think about something. For example, which do you think will have more possibilities for job. Just applying for cleaning dishes because that's easy, or applying for every work field you can work for. This is the same for schools. For an other example, a student that does not know what he wants to do for his future choosing to go to the military, or going to collage with many opportunities. Going to the collage can increase the job opportunities and he might find a better job than going to military.\n",
            "\n",
            "Furthermore, setting our aim high will help people to conceive more unique or their real thoughts than people with rivet thoughts that set their aim too low. For example, people that aim low are most likely conceal or are not aware of their thoughts. This is because people that aim low will not try to achieve something too hard for them. On the other hand, people that aim high will try to achieve more harder tasks, and think about more things. This will help the human brains to develop and can help people to think in a unique way than other people. Famous artists that have created significant art works could have not created anything great if they have set a limit for their self. They all did not make any limit for their self and their abilities to create great works. All the unique ideas and arts exist because the famous artists aimed high.\n",
            "\n",
            "In addition, by setting our aim high we can achieve bigger goals than setting a lower aim for a higher possibility. For example, Just working for the minimum requirement for an assignment than working for the maximum of that assignment, which will give you a better grade? The answer will most likely be working for the maximum of the assignment. If you have your aim low you might give up before you achieve a task even if that was an important task. If your aim is high you won't give up and achieve the task. Therefore, having your aim higher is better than just trying to do the easiest thing you can.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some people might say that by setting the aim too high that can make them suffer. This can be true, but that does not mean you should aim too low. what is important is to keep everything balanced to the best. Everyone has been said to eat a balanced meal when they were a small child. This is the same for everything. Understanding your own abilities and setting the aim to what you can possibly achieve rather than setting the goal for something easy. Some might say that if people don't aim high they won't have to work hard, so they will have less stress. They might have less stress but not every stress is bad for people. Stress can even help people sometimes. For example, I was a student in Japan that hated school and was too lazy to do any work. I had a lot of stress and that made me stay at home all the time. Staying at home did not relieve my stress at all, and I did not feel good about my self. Therefore, I chose to go to school again. Stress will mostly affect bad for you, but there are good affects too.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, The hole point about this is that running away and choosing the easy way is not the best decision. Aiming low might look like it's the simple and easy way thats safer but whats really the danger is for people to forget to aim high and believe they can achieve great things. The best is to make a decision that wont make you regret and making the best aim you can make. No one has to be excellent or perfect, but everyone should try their best in their short life so they can die with no regret.\n",
            "→ I disagree with the decision that all students must participate in an extra curricular activity. Maybe the reason that some students don't actively participate in those activities is because they have conflicts or cannot afford to participate. However, it is good for a student to get activity in a day or do something fun with their brains. Students playing sports or being in clubs is good but not all kids have the luxury to be involved with those things.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here are the three reasons why I think that students should not be forced to participate in an after school activity. One, some students may have serious conflicts that prevent them from doing an activity, such as taking care of relatives and siblings. Two, some students may not be able to afford to be on the team and paying for jerseys or not be able to purchase a camera for yearbook club. Three, some students just may not want to do it. Maybe they would rather just go home and draw or do something by themselves, and not with other people.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, there are two benefits from making this rule. One, making students participate in an extra curricular activity could introduce the kids to something new, that they might really enjoy. Two, participating in one of these activities such as sports or a club helps activate different parts of their brain which they probably wouldn't get in school.\n",
            "\n",
            "I think that the principal could also make it so if a student had a good enough reason that they couldn't or didn't want to partake in an activity then they wouldn't have to. And if a student really wanted to do something but had a conflict, then the principal could try and make time for them.\n",
            "\n",
            "In conclusion, I disagree with the decision to make students participate in an activity. If they couldn't then they can't and the principal can't really do anything about that. And if a student didn't want to then they shouldn't be forced into something they don't want to do. Even though there are a few benefits, I still think that it would be better if this was not a rule.\n",

Some students have trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pace set by teachers. The students cannot always work at the pace set by teachers. Distance learning allows students to work on their own pace and on their own schedule. Additionally, that there are no misguided rules about tardiness or how to dress.

As a result of this, students won't lose focus on the work they are doing resulting in better grades. One of the reasons students get distracted in the first place is because they are in a class where other just fooling around which makes others who want to stay focus feel uncomfortable. If a student learns from home they will feel more relaxed and comfortable and won't stress about work.

Some people may think this is bad thinking because of how hard you try,but you have no success at the end. Yes,i agree with the statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because of these three reasons,failure makes me better than i was at first,never giving up without motivation ,and be able to over come that obstacle that i work so hard for. My first reason, of why failure is a good thing because it makes every body better at what they started with. For example, when i first started learning how to play the guitar i was very afraid that i would never be able to do it. At first i really terrible and failed over and over again. Until one day my friend came over my house and showed me how to do it. But once again i failed off my guitar crazy like. Then my friend started to laugh but in a funny way,so i also stared to laugh too. I ask him why he laugh at me,he told me\" i remember at was like you when i stared to learned guitar\". He also told me he was really proud of me not giving up and failing. what i understood of what he was trying to tell me is that failure can make me better from having that kind of enthusiasm in my spirit. related back to my first reason is that not just giving up,but having a motivation every time i do anything to keep going. In order to have that kind of motivation of getting out of bed and doing what you want to accomplish at the end of the day is looking up to someone who helps you get to work or hustle i can say. For example, famous people who did or was successful in life like Elon Musk who founded Tesla,Steve Jobs who founded Apple,and Oprah Winfrey who founded her own television network. All these people was in our shoes before they became famous. They can motivate us by what people probably said to them like \"no\" or \"it can not be done\". They did not listen to adorers Sayers would though that never would happen. My final reason of why failure is a good thing is to over come any obstacle that can get in your way.
